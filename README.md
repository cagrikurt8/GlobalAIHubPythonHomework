# GlobalAIHubPythonHomework
All homeworks given from 5-day python course.

HW-1 => In the first homework(HW-1), the program prints the input values and their types.

HW-2 => In the second homework(HW-2), the program takes your name-surname, age and birth year, then prints them. Also, it returns you a message according to whether you are over           18.

HW-3 => In the third homework(HW-3), the program takes your name via input and prints a message. Then creates empty lines based on the word which is in the code bunch. 
        Consequently, it expect you to guess the words. You have to enter the words letter by letter and if you enter a wrong letter you have to start from the beginning. 
        Don't forget, you have just 3 attempts!
        
Project => In the project, firstly the program creates a student object named by my name by default, of course you can change the name by editing the code bunch later, then asks              you your name and surname. You have just 3 attempts to enter incorrect name and surname. The program will end unless you enter the name and surname correctly. After you 
           enter your name correctly, the program wants you to enter at least 3 and at most 5 courses. Then, you have to select one of the courses that you enter for exam. Just 
           entering the ordinal of the course will be enough. After that, it asks your midterm, final and project grades to calculate your total grade. Finally, it returns 
           your total grade and letter grade and tells you whether you pass the class.
